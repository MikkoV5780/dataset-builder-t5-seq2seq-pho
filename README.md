Dataset builder for protein phosphorylation site prediction using deep learning models
PhosphoDataBuilder is a specialized tool designed to generate robust training datasets for machine learning models that predict protein phosphorylation sites. 
It addresses limitations in existing phosphorylation databases by incorporating structural context through a novel meta-tagging system, enabling more accurate and context-aware predictions by transformer models.
